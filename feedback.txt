Feedback: Tough to launch.
Responce: Intentional design decision.

Feedback: Set game time limit to a random number between 900 and 1000 to make it look 'natural'
Responce: Nah... It'll decrease when you try to launch... eventually. That would require a new paper to tell the player

Feedback: Change of failure? what does it mean/does it actually affect gameplay? Love achievements! Love the time investments!
Responce: ...Is this just praise? How do we deal with this...? Table the idea for a more clear meaning of the failure.

Feedback: Too many people asking for overtime.
Responce: It is the most common question. (Maybe add different?)

Feedback: Impossible to launch.
Responce: We find it easy, maybe because we made it? maybe make it easier, more testing required. Then again, it isn't easy to reach space.
